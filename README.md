# bioinformatics-ai-project
### RAG Bioinfo Assistant
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based assistant designed to help biological researchers quickly find and summarize relevant information 
from scientific documents, research papers, and internal knowledge bases.

###  Problem Statement
Researchers in bioinformatics often deal with large volumes of technical documents and reports.
Traditional keyword search methods struggle to fetch contextually meaningful information, leading to inefficiencies and time loss.

This project aims to solve that by:
Ingesting biological research documents,
Retrieving the most semantically relevant content chunks,
Generating precise, context-aware answers using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

### Project Features
Document ingestion and chunking
Embedding generation using SentenceTransformers
FAISS-based vector database for efficient semantic search
Retrieval pipeline to fetch top-k relevant chunks
Contextual answer generation using GPT-4
